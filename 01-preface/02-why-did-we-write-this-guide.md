## Why Did We Write This Guide

After the development of the xill core stabilized we started building
plugins there was no tomorrow. Soon it became clear that this would be
something any java developer could do and maybe even like, so we set out
to simplify xill plugin development as much as we reasonably could and
decided to document in detail how to build these plugins. To do this we
took the initiative to start writing a comprehensive guide that would not
only be a simple reference for beginning developers but also provide
some reasonable background to the decisions you would have to make when
creating your own plugin.

The reason we choose for this format is because we can easily publish it
to several platforms so anyone could always have a copy of the guide
available to them.
