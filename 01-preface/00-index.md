# Preface {-}

Birds fly, matches burn, wind blows and content grows. There's very
little you can do about it. It seems like the longer we work with a
certain system the faster its data starts to grow. This is all fine
until we reach the point where the current system no longer fits our
needs and it has to be replaced. This is where the complex migration
projects start.

Back in 2010 Ernst van Rheenen started a mission to make these migration
projects run as smoothly and risk-free as possible. He did this by
developing the first version of a scripting language that allows programmers
to easily connect systems and perform various operations on their content.
Later this prototype was shaped into a tool that was used
by all Xillio's consultants to perform custom migrations. It was able to
withstand the full force of the content thrown at it so that is when, in
2014, development started on the public third iteration of what we now
know as *Xill*. This iteration is presented to everyone who is interested
as an open source project.

Xill is not about providing a standard boxed solution for every content
related project out there. It is about providing a platform for content
consultants and Java developers to work together to create a modular,
resilient, easy and powerful scripting language that can be used to
realize projects with large amounts of content with a little risk as
possible.
